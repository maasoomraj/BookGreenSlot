# Book Green Slot

Book Green Slot is an online appointment scheduling web-based application that helps patients get medical appointments within no time and also makes patient management a lot more easier and efficient for hospitals and clinics . 

## Motivation

 Traditionally, medical appointments have been made over the telephone or in person. However, because these traditional methods require the intervention of schedulers, the ability to get a timely appointment is not only limited by the availability of appointment slots, but also by the schedulers and phone lines. Patientsâ€™ satisfaction with appointment booking is influenced by their ability to book at the right time with the right health service providers which is difficult to achieve using these methods. This motivated us to create Book Green Slot that provides a user-friendly interface both for patients as well as doctors to skip this unnecessary hassle.
